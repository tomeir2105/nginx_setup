# Suggestions

### Project
Good work, yet patching is required
- CONTRIBUTORS.md - capital letters and `.md` extention
- TASKS.md -  capital letters and `.md` extention
- From the script naming it is not clear what runs first
  - better to have `setup.sh` or `manage.sh` that leads to `bin/` folder from where you run whatever script you want/need
### README
Wonderfule README file !!!

### SCRIPT
- versionining needs to be 0.0.0 digit number
- accesseive use of echo command - structure string and print it once, better to use `printf` due to its structuring capabilities
- function need to start with key word `function`
- you are suppose to use [[ and not [
- sensative information needs either to be encoded or encrypted and managed as `local` to function
- static/constant values need to be declarade on the begining of the file
- when using getops, if one of the options precedes other then other option may not be available.
